## [Webogram](https://web.telegram.org) â€” Telegram Web App

Telegram offers great [apps for mobile communication](https://www.telegram.org). It is based on the [MTProto protocol](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto) and has an [Open API](https://core.telegram.org/api). I personally like Telegram for its speed and cloud-support (that makes a web app possible, unlike in the case of WA and others).

MTProto data can be carried over HTTP (SSL is also supported), so this project is my take at creating one.

That said, I'm using this app myself and I'd like to share its sources, so anyone can contribute to the development. Any help is welcome!

### Maintained locations


| Description        | URL           | Type  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----:|
| Online Web-version (hosted on Telegram servers)      | https://web.telegram.org/ | hosted
| Online Web-version (hosted on GitHub pages)      | https://zhukov.github.io/webogram | hosted
| Chrome Web Store      | [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/telegram/ clhhggbfdinjmjhajaheehoeibfljjno](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/telegram/clhhggbfdinjmjhajaheehoeibfljjno) |   packed
| Firefox & FirefoxOS Marketplace | https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/telegram |    packed



**Hosted version**: the app is downloaded via HTTPS as a usual website. Will be available offline due to application cache.

**Packed version**: the app is downloaded at once in a package via HTTPS. The package is updated less frequently than the Web-version.

All of the apps above are submitted and maintained by [@zhukov](https://github.com/zhukov), so feel free to use them and report bugs [here](https://github.com/zhukov/webogram/issues). Please do not report bugs which reproduce only in different locations.
